This repository contains two small python programs that manage your bash command history.  The .ui files contain the GUI description.  They were created by Qt 5 Designer.  The .ui files were converted to python code using the pyuic5 command.  Additional python code was added manually to the .py files.  Both python programs manage your command history.  historyDlg5.py is a simple demonstration program while historyDlg6.py has more bells and whistles.
