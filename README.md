This repository contains three small python programs that search your bash command history.  The *.ui files contain the GUI description. They were created by Qt 5 Designer. The .ui files were converted to python code using the pyuic5 command. Additional python code was added manually to the .py files.  historyDlg5.py is a simple demonstration program while historyDlg6.py has more bells and whistles.  historyDlg7.py adds --help and --version commands to historyDlg6.py.

In order to copy commands to the system clipboard, you must have a system clipboard manager installed on your system.

This project is documented in the January 2019 issue of Linux Format Magazine (LXF245)
