This repository contains three small python programs that search your bash command history.  The .ui files contain the GUI description.  They were created by Qt 5 Designer.  The .ui files were converted to python code using the pyuic5 command.  Additional python code was added manually to the .py files.  These python programs search your command history.  historyDlg5.py is a simple demonstration program while historyDlg6.py has more bells and whistles.  historyDlg7.py adds --help and --version commands to historyDlg6.py.
